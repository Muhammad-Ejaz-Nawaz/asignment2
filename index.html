<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <em>Nature, New Scientist,</em> and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well-thumbed <i>copy of On the Road.</i> It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>

<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unravelling the secrets of the llama DNA, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly did think she had something better to do.</p>
